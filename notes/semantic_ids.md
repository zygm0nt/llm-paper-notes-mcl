The paper addresses the limitations of randomly hashed item IDs in large-scale recommendation systems, which hinder generalization to new and long-tail items. It proposes replacing random IDs with **Semantic IDs (SIDs)**, compact discrete item representations learned from content embeddings using RQ-VAE. To adapt SIDs for ranking models, the authors test **N-gram** and **SentencePiece (SPM)** tokenization methods, finding SPM superior for balancing memorization and generalization. Experiments on YouTubeâ€™s production ranking model show that SIDs outperform both raw content embeddings and random IDs, particularly in handling cold-start and newly introduced videos. Overall, SIDs provide a scalable, efficient, and more generalizable alternative to random IDs in industry-scale recommendation systems.
