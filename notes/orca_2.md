The article titled "Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason" discusses the development of the Orca 2 model, which aims to improve the reasoning abilities of smaller language models (LMs). The research, conducted by Microsoft, builds on the success of Orca 1, which was notable for its use of rich signals like explanation traces, enabling it to outperform conventional models on several benchmarks.

Orca 2 focuses on training small LMs to employ different reasoning strategies suitable for various tasks, moving away from merely imitating larger models. This involves teaching the models various reasoning techniques such as step-by-step processing, recall then generate, and direct answers, among others. The goal is to enable these smaller models to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task, thus optimizing their performance.

The model was evaluated using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks, which correspond to approximately 100 tasks involving over 36,000 unique prompts. The results showed that Orca 2 significantly outperforms similar-sized models and achieves performance levels comparable or superior to those of much larger models on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings. The study makes the Orca 2 model weights publicly available to support further research on developing, evaluating, and aligning smaller LMs.

## Contributions

The training of Orca 2 involves several innovative methods designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller language models (LMs). Here are the key components of the training process as described in the article:

1. **Variety of Reasoning Techniques**: Orca 2 is trained to use multiple reasoning strategies, such as step-by-step processing, recall-then-generate, recall-reason-generate, and direct answers. This approach is intended to equip the model with a diverse set of tools to tackle various types of tasks effectively.

2. **Promotion of Task-Specific Strategies**: Instead of solely relying on imitation learning, where the model would simply replicate the outputs of larger models, Orca 2 is taught to employ the most effective reasoning strategy for each specific task. This is intended to optimize the model's performance by using strategies that are best suited to its capacity and the demands of the task.

3. **Use of Enhanced Training Signals**: Following the approach initiated by Orca 1, Orca 2 utilizes richer training signals that go beyond simple input-output pairs. These signals include detailed explanations and reasoning paths demonstrated by more capable models, which help the smaller model to learn not just what the answers are, but how to reason towards them.

4. **Comprehensive Benchmark Testing**: The training effectiveness is evaluated using a set of 15 diverse benchmarks encompassing around 100 tasks and over 36,000 prompts. This extensive testing ensures that the model can handle a wide variety of tasks and performs well in scenarios that require sophisticated reasoning.

5. **Public Availability of Model Weights**: By making the Orca 2 weights available to the public, the research team supports ongoing research and development efforts in the AI community. This allows others to build upon their work, test the model in different contexts, and potentially improve its capabilities further.

This training approach, emphasizing diversity in reasoning strategies and the ability to select the most appropriate method for each task, sets Orca 2 apart from traditional models and contributes significantly to its advanced performance on complex reasoning tasks.

## How the training works?

The training of Orca 2 effectively utilizes different datasets to enhance the model's performance and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Here’s how different types of datasets contribute to the training process:

1. **FLAN-v2 Collection**: This is the main source for synthetic data generation in Orca 2’s training. It includes several sub-collections such as CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021, and Dialogue, covering a wide range of tasks. By using tasks from these collections, the training process exposes Orca 2 to diverse challenges, enhancing its ability to generalize across different contexts.

2. **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Data**: The training dataset includes a mix of zero-shot user queries and few-shot examples. Zero-shot data means that the model must handle tasks it hasn't seen during training, which helps in improving its ability to generalize. Few-shot examples provide a few examples of the task at hand during inference, allowing the model to adjust its responses based on these examples, which is crucial for tasks where the model needs more context.

3. **Math and Problem-Solving Data**: Datasets like the Deepmind Math dataset and GSM8K are used to teach Orca 2 how to solve complex mathematical and logic problems. This exposure to structured problem-solving tasks is crucial for developing the model's reasoning and computational skills.

4. **Specialized Tasks from FLAN and Other Collections**: Tasks are categorized into sub-categories such as Text Classification, Claim Verification, Data2Text, and more. Each category has tasks designed to train specific capabilities, enhancing Orca 2's proficiency in a structured manner.

5. **Cautious System Instruction Replacement**: During the later stages of training, the specific system instructions that guide the model on how to approach a task are replaced with a generic "cautious system instruction". This method teaches the model to reason and respond cautiously, ensuring it adheres to ethical guidelines and promotes positive behavior.

6. **Synthetic Data for Specialized Skills**: For instance, synthetic doctor-patient conversations are used to teach Orca 2 how to summarize complex dialogues into structured medical notes. This specialized training helps in improving the model’s ability to process and synthesize information from conversational data.

These datasets not only provide a rich source of varied and complex tasks but also help in teaching Orca 2 to approach and solve these tasks using the most effective strategies. This diversified training approach enables Orca 2 to perform robustly across a wide range of benchmarks, matching or even surpassing larger models in reasoning tasks.
