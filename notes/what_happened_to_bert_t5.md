The article "What happened to BERT & T5? On Transformer Encoders, PrefixLM, and Denoising Objectives" by Yi Tay discusses the evolution of language models, particularly the shift from encoder-based models like BERT to more advanced models such as T5. Here are the key points:

1. **Decline of BERT-style Models**: BERT was highly effective for NLP tasks, but it's been largely replaced by more versatile models like T5, which can handle multiple tasks more efficiently. The article questions why we no longer see scaled-up BERT models.

2. **Model Architectures**: The article explains the different types of model architectures: encoder-only models (e.g., BERT), encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5), and decoder-only models (e.g., GPT). While these architectures have fundamental differences, they can often perform similar tasks with varying efficiencies.

3. **Denoising Objectives**: Denoising objectives, used in BERT and adapted in T5, involve masking parts of the input and predicting the missing parts. While effective for training, these objectives are less sample-efficient compared to autoregressive models, where every token is predicted.

4. **Autoregressive Models and PrefixLM**: Autoregressive models, like those based on GPT or PrefixLM, have gained favor due to their ability to handle a wide range of tasks without the need for task-specific heads. T5’s autoregressive nature combined with denoising made it more versatile than BERT.

5. **Efficiency of Encoder-Decoder Models**: Encoder-decoder models like T5 can scale tasks more efficiently by splitting inputs and outputs between encoder and decoder. They offer advantages like bidirectional attention, which aids in tasks like summarization and infilling, but they also face challenges, such as inefficiencies when handling larger inputs.

6. **Unification of Pretraining Tasks**: The unification of pretraining tasks, particularly with models like T5 and UL2, was a significant step in moving away from task-specific models like BERT. This unification allowed for models that could perform a broader set of tasks with the same architecture.

7. **Challenges of Denoising**: While denoising objectives are useful, they suffer from lower loss exposure (i.e., fewer tokens being masked and learned), making them less sample-efficient than autoregressive models, which predict every token.

8. **Current Trends**: Today's models often mix autoregressive and denoising objectives. While denoising remains useful, especially for smaller-scale models, it's generally seen as complementary to more efficient causal language modeling (CLM).

Overall, the article highlights the transition from BERT-style models to more flexible architectures like T5 and PrefixLM, driven by the need for models that can handle multiple tasks efficiently and the limitations of denoising as a standalone training objective.

## Difference between BERT, T5 and GPT

BERT, T5, and GPT are all Transformer-based models, but they have different architectures and training objectives, making them suitable for different tasks. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

- **Architecture**: BERT is an **encoder-only** model. It uses a bidirectional transformer, meaning it looks at both the left and right context of a word in a sentence during training.
- **Training Objective**: BERT is trained using a **Masked Language Model (MLM)** objective. During training, random words in the input sentence are masked, and the model is tasked with predicting these masked words based on the surrounding context. BERT also has a **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** task, where it learns to predict if one sentence follows another in a text.
- **Strengths**: BERT excels at understanding the meaning of a sentence and is particularly good for tasks like question answering, text classification, and named entity recognition.
- **Use Case**: BERT is well-suited for tasks that require understanding the relationship between words and context, such as sentence classification, sentiment analysis, or token-level tasks like named entity recognition.

- **Limitation**: BERT is not capable of generating text since it doesn’t have a decoder and operates on the premise of bidirectional context (not autoregressive).

### 2. **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**

- **Architecture**: T5 is an **encoder-decoder** model, similar to sequence-to-sequence architectures. It uses an encoder to process the input and a decoder to generate the output.
- **Training Objective**: T5 uses a **denoising objective** similar to BERT, where spans of text are masked, but it's trained in a sequence-to-sequence format. Everything is treated as a text-to-text problem, meaning any NLP task (e.g., translation, summarization, question-answering) is converted into a text-to-text format. The model is trained to predict the output text given an input text.
- **Strengths**: T5 is versatile and can perform multiple types of NLP tasks, from text generation to classification. Because it treats everything as a text generation problem, it can handle a wider variety of tasks compared to BERT.
- **Use Case**: T5 can be used for both understanding and generating text. It's used in tasks like machine translation, summarization, and question answering.

- **Limitation**: While flexible, the encoder-decoder setup makes it more computationally expensive compared to models like GPT that only use a decoder.

### 3. **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)**

- **Architecture**: GPT is a **decoder-only** model and uses an autoregressive transformer, meaning it predicts each word based on the previously generated words in a left-to-right manner.
- **Training Objective**: GPT is trained using **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**, where the model predicts the next word in a sequence based solely on the previous context (unidirectional). There’s no concept of masking or bidirectional context.
- **Strengths**: GPT is excellent at text generation and is particularly good for tasks that involve generating coherent and contextually appropriate text. It can handle tasks like dialogue generation, creative writing, and text completion.
- **Use Case**: GPT is mainly used for generative tasks, such as story writing, summarization, and text completion.

- **Limitation**: GPT does not handle tasks that require deep understanding of both left and right context as effectively as BERT (e.g., sentence classification or token classification tasks).

### **Summary of Key Differences**:

- **BERT**: Encoder-only, bidirectional, best for understanding and classification tasks (MLM).
- **T5**: Encoder-decoder, text-to-text format, versatile and suitable for both text generation and understanding (denoising).
- **GPT**: Decoder-only, autoregressive, excels at text generation (CLM). 

In short, BERT is great for understanding, GPT is best for generating, and T5 can do both.
